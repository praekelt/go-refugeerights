This folder contains translation files for each application, with one
sub-folder per application.

The `messages.pot` files are translation template files and are generated
from the Javascript source code using the `./utils/regenerate-pot.sh` script.

The `.po` files are supplied by translators who create them based on the
`.pot` templates. The `.po` files are copied into the folder by hand and
placed next to their corresponding `messages.pot` file.

The `.json` files are JSON formatted versions of the `.po` files and
are generated using the `./utils/regenerate-json.sh` scripts.

Please do not edit the generated files by hand.
